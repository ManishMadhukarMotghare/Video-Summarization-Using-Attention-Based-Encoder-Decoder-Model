# Video-Summarization-Using-Attention-Based-Encoder-Decoder-Model
In this model we uses Attention Based model to summarize the video. The output of the video will be 15% of the original video as summary. Also It's a Supervised Model.

## Model
Encoder Decoder based Model with Attention Mechanism

## Encoder 
Bi-Directional LSTM Network

## Decoder
LSTM Network

## Key Shots
Generated by solving 0/1 knapsack problem with help of Dynamic Programming
