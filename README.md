# Video-Summarization-Using-Attention-Based-Encoder-Decoder-Model
In this model we uses Attention Based model to summarize the video. The output of the video will be 15% of the original video as summary. Also It's a Supervised Model.

## Model
Encoder Decoder based Model with Attention Mechanism

## Encoder 
Bi-Directional LSTM Network.

an encoder converts the input sequence X = {x1, x2, ..., xT } into a representation vector v= {v1,v2, · · · ,vT}.

## Decoder
